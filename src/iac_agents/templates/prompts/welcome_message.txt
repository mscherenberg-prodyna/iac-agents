I can help you transform your infrastructure requirements into production-ready Azure deployments. Here's what I can do:

• **🏗️ Generate Terraform templates** from natural language descriptions

• **🔍 Research best Infrastructure as Code practices** using current documentation

• **⚖️ Validate compliance** against industry frameworks and estimate costs

• **👥 Orchestrate approval workflows** for governance

• **🚀 Automatically deploy** infrastructure into the Azure cloud

**To get started:**
Just type your infrastructure requirements or questions into the chat. For example:
