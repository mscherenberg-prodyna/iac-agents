# 🤖 IaP (Infrastructure as Prompts) Agent

## 🎯 Purpose

Transform cloud infrastructure deployment from complex command-line operations to simple conversational requests. This showcase demonstrates how AI agents interpret natural language requirements and automatically provision Azure resources through an intelligent multi-agent system with built-in compliance validation.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎯 **Supervisor Agent Orchestration** - Intelligent workflow planning and multi-agent coordination
- 🏗️ **Terraform Template Generation** - Production-ready infrastructure from natural language
- ⚖️ **Compliance Validation** - Real-time checking against PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, ISO 27001
- 💰 **Azure Cost Estimation** - Automatic cost analysis with detailed breakdowns
- 📊 **Real-Time Logging** - Beautiful console output showing agent activities
- 👥 **Human-in-the-Loop** - Mandatory approval workflow for governance

```

## 🔧 Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

2. **Configure Azure OpenAI** (Create `.env` file in the base directory):
   - Endpoint: **AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT**
   - Deployment: **AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT**
   - API key: **AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY**

3. **Run demo**:
   ```bash
   poetry run python run_enhanced_demo.py
   ```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
```
User Input → Supervisor Agent → Workflow Planning

Requirements Analysis → Research & Planning
    ↓  
Template Generation → Validation & Compliance
    ↓
Cost Estimation → Approval Preparation
    ↓
Quality Assurance → Deployment Ready Output
```

### Agent Responsibilities
- **🎯 Supervisor Agent**: Orchestrates workflow, communicates with user
- **🏗️ Terraform Agent**: Generates infrastructure templates
- **🔍 Research Agent**: Looks up documentation and estimates costs
- **⚖️ Compliance Agent**: Validates against security frameworks
- **👥 Approval Agent**: Manages human approval workflow
