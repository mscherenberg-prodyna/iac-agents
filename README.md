## 🎯 Purpose

Transform cloud infrastructure deployment from complex command-line operations to simple conversational requests. Demonstrates how AI agents interpret natural language requirements and automatically provision Azure resources through an intelligent multi-agent system with built-in compliance validation.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎯 **Supervisor Agent Orchestration** - Intelligent workflow planning and multi-agent coordination
- 🏗️ **Terraform Template Generation** - Production-ready infrastructure from natural language
- ⚖️ **Compliance Validation** - Real-time checking against PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, ISO 27001
- 💰 **Azure Cost Estimation** - Automatic cost analysis with detailed breakdowns
- 📊 **Real-Time Logging** - Beautiful console output showing agent activities
- 👥 **Human-in-the-Loop** - Mandatory approval workflow for governance

## 🔧 Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

2. **Configure Azure OpenAI** (Create `.env` file in the base directory):
   - Endpoint: **AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT**
   - Deployment: **AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT**
   - API key: **AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY**

3. **Run Streamlit Web Interface**:
   ```bash
   poetry run streamlit run src/iac_agents/streamlit/gui.py
   ```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
```
User Input → Cloud Architect Agent → Workflow and Infrastructure Planning
    ↓  
Template Generation → Align with current best practices and documentation
    ↓
Compliance and Cost Estimation → Approval Preparation
    ↓
Deployment Approval → Deploy Template to Cloud
```
